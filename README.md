# Hi, I'm Rahul Padinhappurath Bharathan

**ML Engineer & AI Engineer** | Building intelligent systems from research to production

I bridge the gap between ML research and real-world AI applications — from training models and building evaluation pipelines to deploying LLM-powered agents at scale. Currently at **Airbus**, working on trustworthy AI systems.

## What I Do

**Machine Learning** — Uncertainty estimation, RLHF, active learning, recommender systems, sensor fusion
**AI Engineering** — LLM agents, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks, MLOps

## Technical Skills

| ML & Research | AI & Production |
|---------------|-----------------|
| PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face | LangChain, LangGraph, Google ADK |
| Conformal Prediction, RLHF, Active Learning | Vertex AI, RAG, Agent Evaluation |
| MATLAB, Kalman Filters, RANSAC | Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins CI/CD |
| Pandas, NumPy, Plotly | GCP, REST APIs, Microservices |

## Featured Work

### ML Research & Development
- **Trustworthy AI** — Uncertainty estimation with Conformal Prediction for calibrated model abstention
- **RLHF Pipeline** — REINFORCE + Bradley-Terry reward modeling with KL-divergence optimization
- **Active Learning** — Uncertainty sampling strategies reducing labeling costs for NLP tasks
- **5G Localization** — RANSAC-UKF sensor fusion achieving 23% error reduction

### AI Engineering & LLM Systems
- **Autonomous Agents** — Enterprise workflow automation with LangChain, LangGraph, and Google ADK
- **Agent Evaluation Toolkit** — Custom metrics, trajectory analysis, and Plotly dashboards for Vertex AI
- **Knowledge Base Pipeline** — Jenkins CI/CD for document ingestion to Cloud Datastore + Agent Builder
